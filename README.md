##What I am pleased with
I am pleased about the fact that I have been able to pick up C# again after not using it for so long. When I saw, in the breif, that findmypast are currently using C# and JavaScript I felt that, although I have currently been burried in Python, it would be worth my time to brush back up on my C# for this assessment. 

##If I had more time
If I had more time to commit to the assessment I would have added handling for bad user input and tested different input types. I also think that the code could do with some extra refactoring. My intention would be to improve the prime number generators performance. This could be done by removing checks of multiples of previously checked numbers. For example if a number does not divide by three, it also wouldn't divide by, 6, 9, 12, 15 etc.
